<p><b>In addition to those three Champions League finals, Ronaldo scored against Barcelona in the 2017 Spanish Super Cup, and netted a total of four times over two Club World Cup finals: 2016 against Kashima Antlers and 2017 against Gremio.</b></p>

<p>Wednesday's Supercoppa win continued a strong first season with Juve for Ronaldo, with the forward now having scored 16 goals in all competitions for the Bianconeri.</p>

<p>Speaking to Rai Sport after the match, <b><u>Massimiliano Allegri</u></b> hailed the Portuguese, stating that decisive goals are precisely the reason the Italian champions signed him.</p>

<ul>
<li>"We signed Cristiano Ronaldo because he is decisive and scores big goals," he said.</li>

<li>"He scored a great goal and moved very well, but the whole team put in a good performance.</li>

<li>"There were a few too many counter-attacks - we should've had more moves like the [Paulo] Dybala disallowed goal.</li> 

<li>"Instead, we kept trying to move it around too quickly and allowed Milan some counters, forcing us to sprint back."</li>
</ul>

<p>Juventus and Milan went into the match tied for the most Supercoppa wins with seven apiece, and now Juve are in sole posession of first place after winning their eighth title.</p>
